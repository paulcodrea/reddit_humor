In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day. The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.","['Each', 'year', 'I', 'eagerly', 'anticipate', 'day', 'I', 'share', 'favorite', 'Dad', 'Joke', 'time', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'back', '1912', 'Hellmann', 'mayonnaise', 'manufactured', 'England', 'In', 'fact', 'Titanic', 'carrying', '12', '000', 'jars', 'condiment', 'scheduled', 'delivery', 'Vera', 'Cruz', 'Mexico', 'next', 'port', 'call', 'great', 'ship', 'stop', 'New', 'York', 'This', 'would', 'largest', 'single', 'shipment', 'mayonnaise', 'ever', 'delivered', 'Mexico', 'But', 'know', 'great', 'ship', 'make', 'New', 'York', 'The', 'ship', 'hit', 'iceberg', 'sank', 'cargo', 'forever', 'lost', 'The', 'people', 'Mexico', 'crazy', 'mayonnaise', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'delivery', 'disconsolate', 'loss', 'Their', 'anguish', 'great', 'declared', 'National', 'Day', 'Mourning', 'still', 'observe', 'day', 'The', 'National', 'Day', 'Mourning', 'occurs', 'year', 'May', '5th', 'known', 'course', 'Sinko', 'de', 'Mayo']",95,1,each year i eagerly anticipate day i share favorite dad joke time most people know back 1912 hellmann mayonnaise manufactured england in fact titanic carrying 12 000 jars condiment scheduled delivery vera cruz mexico next port call great ship stop new york this would largest single shipment mayonnaise ever delivered mexico but know great ship make new york the ship hit iceberg sank cargo forever lost the people mexico crazy mayonnaise eagerly awaiting delivery disconsolate loss their anguish great declared national day mourning still observe day the national day mourning occurs year may 5th known course sinko de mayo

In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day. The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.","['Each', 'year', 'I', 'eagerly', 'anticipate', 'day', 'I', 'share', 'favorite', 'Dad', 'Joke', 'time', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'back', '1912', 'Hellmann', 'mayonnaise', 'manufactured', 'England', 'In', 'fact', 'Titanic', 'carrying', '12', '000', 'jars', 'condiment', 'scheduled', 'delivery', 'Vera', 'Cruz', 'Mexico', 'next', 'port', 'call', 'great', 'ship', 'stop', 'New', 'York', 'This', 'would', 'largest', 'single', 'shipment', 'mayonnaise', 'ever', 'delivered', 'Mexico', 'But', 'know', 'great', 'ship', 'make', 'New', 'York', 'The', 'ship', 'hit', 'iceberg', 'sank', 'cargo', 'forever', 'lost', 'The', 'people', 'Mexico', 'crazy', 'mayonnaise', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'delivery', 'disconsolate', 'loss', 'Their', 'anguish', 'great', 'declared', 'National', 'Day', 'Mourning', 'still', 'observe', 'day', 'The', 'National', 'Day', 'Mourning', 'occurs', 'year', 'May', '5th', 'known', 'course', 'Sinko', 'de', 'Mayo']",95,1,each year i eagerly anticipate day i share favorite dad joke time most people know back 1912 hellmann mayonnaise manufactured england in fact titanic carrying 12 000 jars condiment scheduled delivery vera cruz mexico next port call great ship stop new york this would largest single shipment mayonnaise ever delivered mexico but know great ship make new york the ship hit iceberg sank cargo forever lost the people mexico crazy mayonnaise eagerly awaiting delivery disconsolate loss their anguish great declared national day mourning still observe day the national day mourning occurs year may 5th known course sinko de mayo
