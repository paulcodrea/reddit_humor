After doing some digging, he came across a Chevy Nova in an auction in Champagne, LA. It was in bad shape, but he took a chance, won the bid, and spent several months doing body work and souping the engine up until it was as good as anything he’d jumped in before. Tragedy struck on the day of the jump, though. The engine suddenly failed just as Roy was leaving the ramp, and the car lost distance, slammed into the opposite wall of the canyon, and plummeted to the ground. Not only was it pancaked by the fall, it was further crushed by rocks dislodged by the initial impact. Roy was thusly immortalized in the local paper: Caught beneath the landslide In a Champagne super Nova in the sky.","['In', 'memoriam', 'Rapid', 'Roy', 'was', 'a', 'daredevil', 'who', 'specialized', 'in', 'car', 'stunts', 'He', 'decided', 'to', 'retire', 'in', 'style', 'and', 'end', 'his', 'career', 'by', 'attempting', 'a', 'canyon', 'jump', 'in', 'the', 'worst', 'car', 'he', 'could', 'find', 'After', 'doing', 'some', 'digging', 'he', 'came', 'across', 'a', 'Chevy', 'Nova', 'in', 'an', 'auction', 'in', 'Champagne', 'LA', 'It', 'was', 'in', 'bad', 'shape', 'but', 'he', 'took', 'a', 'chance', 'won', 'the', 'bid', 'and', 'spent', 'several', 'months', 'doing', 'body', 'work', 'and', 'souping', 'the', 'engine', 'up', 'until', 'it', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'anything', 'he', 'd', 'jumped', 'in', 'before', 'Tragedy', 'struck', 'on', 'the', 'day', 'of', 'the', 'jump', 'though', 'The', 'engine', 'suddenly', 'failed', 'just', 'as', 'Roy', 'was', 'leaving', 'the', 'ramp', 'and', 'the', 'car', 'lost', 'distance', 'slammed', 'into', 'the', 'opposite', 'wall', 'of', 'the', 'canyon', 'and', 'plummeted', 'to', 'the', 'ground', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'it', 'pancaked', 'by', 'the', 'fall', 'it', 'was', 'further', 'crushed', 'by', 'rocks', 'dislodged', 'by', 'the', 'initial', 'impact', 'Roy', 'was', 'thusly', 'immortalized', 'in', 'the', 'local', 'paper', 'Caught', 'beneath', 'the', 'landslide', 'In', 'a', 'Champagne', 'super', 'Nova', 'in', 'the', 'sky']",164,0,In memoriam Rapid Roy was a daredevil who specialized in car stunts He decided to retire in style and end his career by attempting a canyon jump in the worst car he could find After doing some digging he came across a Chevy Nova in an auction in Champagne LA It was in bad shape but he took a chance won the bid and spent several months doing body work and souping the engine up until it was as good as anything he d jumped in before Tragedy struck on the day of the jump though The engine suddenly failed just as Roy was leaving the ramp and the car lost distance slammed into the opposite wall of the canyon and plummeted to the ground Not only was it pancaked by the fall it was further crushed by rocks dislodged by the initial impact Roy was thusly immortalized in the local paper Caught beneath the landslide In a Champagne super Nova in the sky

The engine suddenly failed just as Roy was leaving the ramp, and the car lost distance, slammed into the opposite wall of the canyon, and plummeted to the ground. Not only was it pancaked by the fall, it was further crushed by rocks dislodged by the initial impact.
